## KiwiCloud

KiwiCloud takes usage statistics into a sqlite db and creates tag-clouds as png

Statistics are taken from KiWi's /users json statistics. You have to be in KiWi's local network to get those data

For now it's beta and not fully dynamic configurationwise. Please look at the code and modify as you need.
Feel free to contribute changes.
